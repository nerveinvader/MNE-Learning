# Decoding Preparatory Neural State Prior to Speech
Can we detect and decode EEG pattern prior to speaking or cenceptualization of an idea?

## Problem
Individuals with autism, aphasia, locked-in syndrome, etc. struggle to initiate speech or sometimes conceptualize, even when they have a clear understanding of what they are going to say. If we can detect their intent we could:
1. Develop assistive device to initiate before struggling happens,
2. Help therapists identify cognitive readiness,
3. Develop a thought-to-prompt interface,
4. More importantly, understand how the brain translates thoughts to linguistic formulation.

## Gap
Many studies and papers investigate motor intent, emotions, steady-state, and imagined speech; However, attempts to decode preparatory neural state before speech or conceptulaization are a few.

## Goal
We are attempting to detect, analyze and decode EEG patterns prior to initiation of speaking, explaining and conceptualization
