# Decoding Preparatory Neural State Before Speech
Can we detect and decode EEG patterns before speaking or conceptualizing an idea?

## Problem
Individuals with autism, aphasia, locked-in syndrome, etc., struggle to initiate speech or sometimes conceptualize, even when they have a clear understanding of what they are going to say. If we can detect their intent, we could:
1. Develop an assistive device to initiate before struggling happens,
2. Help therapists identify cognitive readiness,
3. Develop a thought-to-prompt interface,
4. More importantly, understand how the brain translates thoughts to linguistic formulation.

## Gap
Many studies and papers investigate motor intent, emotions, steady-state, and imagined speech; However, attempts to decode preparatory neural state before speech or conceptualization are few.

## Goal
We are attempting to detect, analyze, and decode EEG patterns before initiation of speaking, explaining, and conceptualization.
